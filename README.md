# Bee Booking Front End

Welcome to our site! This is a fun interactive SPA (single page application) that allows a user to interact with our [backend API](https://bee-store.herokuapp.com/). In this site, the user can view, add, delete, and reserve bees. Our app allows a user to add a photo of their choosing. Please be respectful with what you upload as it will be public for all. Please also allow up to a minute for our backend to process the photo and make it viewable on the home and details pages.
Have fun!
